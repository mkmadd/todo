Alembic for handling database migrations  (also look at SQLAlchemy-migrate)
Flask-Security for handling

Structure from miguel grinberg's flask mega tutorial - http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world
Oauth code from miguel grinberg's OAuth Authentication with Flask - https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flask-oauth-example
Alembic and config.py code from https://realpython.com/blog/python/flask-by-example-part-1-project-setup/

#!/usr/bin/env python  # problems with running $ run.py.  $ ./run.py after UNIX EOL ending conversion worked

Trying to pip install psycopg2, got "Error: You need to install postgresql-server-dev-X.Y for building a server-side
extension or libpq-dev for building a client-side application."
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

Then error: command 'i686-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1 trying to pip install psycopg2
sudo apt-get install python-dev
That got it to work

Got into issue with database migrations: when deleted Projects, trying to upgrade after migration gave error because Todo dependent on Project.  Manually deleted all tables from database, but then Alembic was stuck on an upgraded migration.  To get around it, `$ python manage.py db stamp head` to tell Alembic that at most updated version, then ran db migrate and db upgrade again

Tried to install git with sudo apt-get install git and couldn't reach archive.ubuntu.com - had to vagrant halt and vagrant up to get it working

Problems with authentication:
Google - "KeyError: 'Decoder failed to handle access_token with data as returned by provider. A different decoder may be needed." -> using decoder: json.loads in get_auth_session fixed
Twitter - "KeyError: 'Decoder failed to handle oauth_token with data as returned by provider. A different decoder may be needed ... Desktop applications only support the oauth_callback value ‘oob’/oauth/request_token" -> setting a callback url in twitter app settings fixed issue

Issue with inability to delete table 'user'.  Would fail telling me another table had user as foreign key, despite cascade='all, delete-orphan'.  Problem was that 'user' is postgresql reserved word.  Changing tablename to client_user fixed problem.

Problems trying to post form with AJAX when the form was inserted via another AJAX call.
First, the js code had to be on the form html snippet that was loaded, or it wouldn't find the form id when registering the submit event function.  Second, had problems with posting immediately after loading edit form.
Had to separate out the submit event registration and the ajax call into separate function.

When dynamically adding li element to ul, my on click function wasn't working for the new elements:
$('.nav.nav-pills .li').on('click', function(){
	$('.nav.nav-pills li.active').removeClass('active');
	$(this).addClass('active');
});
Got it to work by changing to:
$('.nav.nav-pills').on('click', 'li', function(){
	$('.nav.nav-pills li.active').removeClass('active');
	$(this).addClass('active');
});

Problems on heroku final deployment:
	- needed to set envs.  Setting OAUTH_CREDENTIALS as JSON string didn't work, had to change code to json.loads(os.environ.get('OAUTH_CREDENTIALS') to get from str to dict
	- needed to change redirect callback uri setting at all social providers before logins worked
	- After stamp heading and upgrading db migrations, still didn't work.  Reset the db from https://postgres.heroku.com/databases/ then rewrote populate.py to simply call db.create_all() and ran on heroku

Issue - "InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not available."  Either upgrade to python 2.7.9 or `pip install requests[security]`.  Did the latter, had to `sudo apt-get install libffi-dev` first
